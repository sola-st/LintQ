# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.22.0
- **Python version**: 3.8.0
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 18.04

# What is happening?
In the file [bell_states_example.py](https://github.com/0tt3r/QuaC-qiskit/blob/6fda8db41e6cbdab11059f036a34fa9e410d11a8/examples/demos/bell_states_example.py#LL16-L24C27) the `measure_all` api call creates a register even if the two circuits `circuit` and `circuit2` already have a classical register. This is due to the default behavior of `measure_all` which always insert a new register if no explicitly mentioned.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run this code with any Qiskit version:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer

circuit2 = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
circuit2.h(0)
circuit2.cx(0, 1)
circuit2.measure_all()
# print the classical registers
print(circuit2.cregs)

counts = execute(circuit2, Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'), shots=1000).result().get_counts()
print(counts)
```
It will give you the following output with extra registers:
```python
[ClassicalRegister(2, 'c'), ClassicalRegister(2, 'meas')]
{'11 00': 506, '00 00': 494}
```
Where two additional empty classical bits are present making the output longer and difficult to parse.

# What should happen?
I would expect the existing classical register to be used instead to avoid waste of space.

# Any suggestions?
Following the documentation of the [`measure_all`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.measure_all.html) method, it is possible to measure the qubits directly, without adding an extra register. The code should be changed to:
```python
circuit2.measure_all(add_bits=False)
```
or with the `measure` method:
```python
circuit2.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])
```
