 - **Checker**: DoubleMeas
 - **Problem Description**: Redundant measurement
 - **Intended Behavior**: Tutorial exercise where explicitely asked to add a double measurmenet to verify that the the two get the same result.
 - **Additional Comments**: The behaviour is confeirmed by the taks of the exercise. Two measurment are executed on the same qubit giving the same reusult.
 - **Relevant Lines**:
```python
   
   
   #
   # YOUR CODE HERE
   inp = qiskit.QuantumRegister(1, 'input')
   meas = qiskit.ClassicalRegister(2, 'measure')
   
   circuit = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(inp, meas)
   circuit.h(inp[0])
   circuit.measure(inp[0], meas[0])
   circuit.measure(inp[0], meas[1])  # <=== PROBLEM LOCATION
   
   simulator = qiskit.Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
   job = execute(circuit, simulator, shots=1000)
   result = job.result()
   counts = result.get_counts(circuit)
   print(counts)
   
   
   # # Measuring multiqubit systems
   # 
   # **Exercise 4** (1 point). We typically work with local measurements, meaning that the qubits are measured separately. Create a two-qubit circuit with measurements included that reproduces the uniform distribution on four outcomes.
