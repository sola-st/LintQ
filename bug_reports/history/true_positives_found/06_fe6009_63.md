 - **Checker**: DoubleMeas
 - **Problem Description**: Redundant measurment 
 - **Intended Behavior**: Implementation of an inefficient NOT with errors.
 - **Additional Comments**: measured the same qubit twice
 - **Relevant Lines**:
```python
       """We apply a predefined number of inefficiencies.
       Unfortunately, and contrary to our expectations, this did not yield a decreased
       accuracy result when running on a quantum computer. For the inefficiency-reduced accuracy,
       we will use the NOT() function instead"""
