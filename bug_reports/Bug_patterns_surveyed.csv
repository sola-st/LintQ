Incorrect use of quantum gate,,,IncorrectQuantumGate,,x,,,,,The wrong gate is used.,QChecker
Intermediate measurement,x,,OpAfterMeas,,,,,,,"Measurements affect the state of the entire system, making it prone to more errors. Therefore, measurements should be postponed to be the very last operation on the circuit to avoid error propagation.",QSmell
Excute without Coupling Map,~,,,x,,,,,,An execute call without a coupling map could lead to an inefficient mapping to HW.,QChecker
Use of Customized Gates,~,,,x,,,,,,Any customized gate is decomposable into built-in operators of the framework. This decomposition requires a substantial higher number of operators when compared to the equivalent solution made exclusively of built-in operators.,QSmell
Idle Qubits,~,,,x,,,,,,With current technology it is only possible to ensure the correctness of a state for very short periods of time. Having idle qubits for too long enhance the loss of quantum information that may jeopardize the results of a quantum circuit.,QSmell
Initialization of Qubits differently from |0>,~,,,x,,,,,,"Keeping the coherence of a quantum excited state is technologically difficult. Hence, initially one should keep it in its ground state (i.e., in state |0i) as long as possible.",QSmell
No-alignment between the Logical and Physical Qubits,~,,,x,,,,,,"The topology of real qubits impacts the circuit behavior, i.e., the results obtained from the circuit can change according to the physical qubits configuration. Therefore, not aligning the logical qubits to the proper physical qubits may lead to less accurate results.",QSmell
Long circuit,~,,,,x,,,,,"Unitary gates and measurements are prone to errors (specially due to quantum noise). The higher the depth of the circuit and/or wider the circuit, the higher is the probability of affecting a quantum circuit’s intended behavior.",QSmell
IncorrectQuantumGate,,,,,x,,,,,use the wrong quantum gate,A Comprehensive Study of Bug Fixes in Quantum Programs
Incorrect initial state,,,,,x,,,,,"initialize the statevector differently, e.g. replace  Statevector.from_label(’01’) with  Statevector.from_label(’10’)",A Comprehensive Study of Bug Fixes in Quantum Programs
Wrong endianess,,,,,x,,,,,"measure the values assuming opposite endianess, e.g. replace circuit.measure([0,1,2], [0,1,2]) with circuit.measure([0,1,2], [2,1,0])",A Comprehensive Study of Bug Fixes in Quantum Programs
Potential all zeros matrix,,,,,,x,,,,"potential all zeros matrix, e.g. .dot(unitary[randnum[0]] - id)",A Comprehensive Study of Bug Fixes in Quantum Programs
Result bit not used,,,,,,,x,,,The dictionary containing the results of the measurements is not accessed at a specific classical bit position.,Quantum-CPG
Constant result bit,,,,,,,x,,,The value of a measrued bit is constant and used by some classical function.,Quantum-CPG
Not-unitary matrix for gate/noise,,,,,,,x,,,"not unitary matrix used in a gate: e.g.  [[[1, 0], [0, 0]], [[0, 0], [0.995004165, 0.099833417]]]",A Comprehensive Study of Bug Fixes in Quantum Programs
Check reuse of a physical qubit in a coupling map,,,,,,,x,,,Check if a coupling map is assigning two different logical qubits to the same physical qubit,QChecker
MeasureOutOfBound,,,,,,,x,,,"Insufficient length of classical registers, a measurement is applied and the result is stored into a classical register index which is greater than the max register size.",QChecker
Repeated set of Operations on Circuit,~,,,,,,,x,,"Due to technological and physical limitations, the number of operations one can pass to a quantum computer is limited, therefore the circuit implementing the whole algorithm should be prepared in such a way that the number of sequential repeated set of operations to be performed is the least possible.",QSmell
Append circuit without to_gate,,,,,,,,x,,An append call without the to_gate() conversion to an instruction. [NOW it is POSSIBLE],QChecker
Excute without Transpile,~,,,,,,,x,,A circuit is passed to execute without transpiling it first [NOW it is POSSIBLE],QChecker

Check wrong arguments for gates,~,,,,,,,,x,"Check if the gates 'ccx', 'mcx', 'rccx', 'rcccx', 'mcu1', 'cswap' receive a 'label' or 'Label' argument.",QChecker
ImproperDraw,≈,,,,,,,,x,"The draw function does not return a string, but it has to be used as is: e.g. replace print(qc.draw(output='mpl')) with qc.draw(output='mlp')",A Comprehensive Study of Bug Fixes in Quantum Programs
UndefinedBackend,~,,,,,,,,x,Check if the backend variable is used but never defined,QChecker
SuperfluousOp,≈,,,,,,x,,,A gate that does not get measured and does not influence (happens before) any other gate.,Quantum-CPG
MultipleSubmissions,≈,,,,,,x,,,"Real devices work in a shared policy. To reduce communication payloads and avoid queuing for different initial values, the circuit should be designed parametrically to allow the different initial values to be provided at once. (originally: Non-parameterized Circuit)",QSmell
