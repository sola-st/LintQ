# What is happening?
In the Python file [n_qubit_grovers_algorithm.py](https://github.com/noahmaasaw/nqubitgrovers/blob/62bcf46ccc400775622a9204c2311eccabcb75e9/n_qubit_grovers_algorithm.py#L114) the `qc.measure_all()` call creates a new classical register and does not use the one already provided during initialization via `qc = QuantumCircuit(q,q)`.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
I demonstrate the issue at a smaller scale, becasue I cannot simulate such a large circuit, but the issue is even more important when the register allocated are bigger. Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer

circuit = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)
circuit.x(0)
circuit.x(4)
circuit.measure_all()  # <-- this will create a new classical register

sim = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
counts = sim.run(circuit).result().get_counts()
print(counts)  # <-- you can see the output here
```
The output will be `{'10001 00000': 1024}`. There are double the number of bits in the output, because the classical register is not used.

# What should happen?
I would have expected to use the classical register already provided during initialization.

# Any suggestions?
What about using the `add_bits=False` flag in the `measure_all` method to reuse the existing classical register? Here is the suggested version:

```python
qc.measure_all(add_bits=False)
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
