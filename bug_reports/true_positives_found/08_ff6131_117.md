 - **Checker**: MeasAllAbuse
 - **Problem Description**: Measure all generates a twice as long output (Grover algo)
 - **Intended Behavior**: They run grover algo and they want to submit the job to the IBMQ cloud without monitoring it in code, thus they want to inspect the result there.
 - **Additional Comments**: The measure to the correct classical register, but then they also measure all, thus doubling the output for no reasons.
 - **Relevant Lines**:
```python

       qc.barrier(qr)
       for i in range(0, q%(q-3), 4):
           qc.measure(qr[i], cr[i])
           qc.measure(qr[i+1], cr[i+1])
           qc.measure(qr[i+2], cr[i+2])
           qc.measure(qr[i+3], cr[i+3])
