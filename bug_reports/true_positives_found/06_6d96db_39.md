 - **Checker**: MeasAllAbuse
 - **Problem Description**: Measure all generates a twice as long output (OR function)
 - **Intended Behavior**: or function. Ideally only the result of the or, aka the single classical register is measured.
 - **Additional Comments**: here the other ancilla qubits are measured as well leading to an unused cr and a long output with spaces.
 - **Relevant Lines**:
```python
           
       qc.barrier()
       
       qc.ccx(inp[0], inp[1],anc)
       qc.cx(anc, out)
       qc.cx(out, final_res)
       qc.cx(anc, out)
       qc.ccx(inp[0], inp[1],anc)
       
       qc.barrier()
       qc.measure_all()  # <=== PROBLEM LOCATION
       
       qcl.draw_circuit(qc)
       
       simulator = QasmSimulator()
       compiled_circuit = transpile(qc, simulator)
       shots = 1000
       job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots)
       results = job.result()
       counts = results.get_counts(compiled_circuit)
       return counts
