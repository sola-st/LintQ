# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.45.2
- **Python version**: 3.10.12
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [code.py](https://github.com/USTC-Hackergame/hackergame2022-writeups/blob/46e8478c0c89cc187133ee2dc8378ae2b8866784/players/cvhc/%E9%87%8F%E5%AD%90%E8%97%8F%E5%AE%9D%E5%9B%BE/code.py) the `qc.measure_all()` call creates a new classical register and does not use the one already provided during initialization via `QuantumCircuit(129,128)`.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
I demonstrate the issue at a smaller scale, becasue I cannot simulate such a large circuit, but the issue is even more important when the register allocated are bigger. Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer

circuit = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)
circuit.x(0)
circuit.x(4)
circuit.measure_all()  # <-- this will create a new classical register

sim = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
counts = sim.run(circuit).result().get_counts()
print(counts)  # <-- you can see the output here
```
The output will be `{'10001 00000': 1024}`. There are double the number of bits in the output, because the classical register is not used.

# What should happen?
I would have expected to use the classical register already provided during initialization.

# Any suggestions?
What about using the `add_bits=False` flag in the `measure_all` method to reuse the existing classical register? Here is the suggested version:

```python
qc.measure_all(add_bits=False)
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
