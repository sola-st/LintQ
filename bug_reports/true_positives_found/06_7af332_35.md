# What is happening?
The `measure_all` in the file [ghz.py](https://github.com/pnnl/SV-Sim/blob/3a22b3137c8f35b92375548ac9a94c1f47c35aa8/svsim/crusher/qiskit/test/ghz.py) of the test suite adds (perhaps involuntarily) another classical register instead of using the existing one. This makes the output double as big as it should be, with an empty register.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following section of the circuit:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit import execute, Aer

n_qubits = 10

def cx_chain(qc,n):
    for i in range(0,n-1):
        qc.cx(i,i+1)

qc = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits, n_qubits)
qc.h(0)
cx_chain(qc,n_qubits)
qc.measure_all()

simulator = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
job1 = execute(qc,simulator,shots=1000)
result1 = job1.result()
counts1 = result1.get_counts(qc)
print (counts1)
```
Output:
```
{'1111111111 0000000000': 498, '0000000000 0000000000': 502}
```

# What should happen?
The existing register should be used instead of adding a new one.

# Any suggestions?
Following the documentation of the [`measure_all`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.measure_all.html) method, it is possible to measure the qubits directly, without adding an extra register. The code should be changed to:
```python
qc.measure_all(add_bits=False)
```
This produces the following:
```
{'1111111111': 531, '0000000000': 469}
```
