# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.45.2
- **Python version**: 3.10.12
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [qubitStates.py](https://github.com/vicvaleeva/qiskit-learn/blob/e8d179369e6c3f4ba815604f8183cec5044a8c7a/QuantumStates/qubitStates.py#L11) you have two measurements that are applied to the same qubits one after the other, making the second measurement redundant.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
from qiskit import execute, Aer, QuantumCircuit
from math import pi, sqrt
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 2)
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
statevector = [1/sqrt(2), 1j/sqrt(2)]
qc.initialize(statevector, 0)
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.measure(0, 1)
result = execute(qc, backend).result()
counts = result.get_counts()
print(counts)
# {'00': 523, '11': 501}
```
You get two measurements on the same qubits, namely the same value is stored both at position 0 and 1 of the classical register.

# What should happen?
I would have expected the circuit to use only one classical register, and one measurement.

# Any suggestions?
What about the following code?

```python
from qiskit import execute, Aer, QuantumCircuit
from math import pi, sqrt
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
statevector = [1/sqrt(2), 1j/sqrt(2)]
qc.initialize(statevector, 0)
qc.measure(0, 0)
result = execute(qc, backend).result()
counts = result.get_counts()
print(counts)
# {'1': 481, '0': 543}
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
