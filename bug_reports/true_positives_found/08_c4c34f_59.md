# What is happening?
The file [real_system.py](https://github.com/DiracMG3/Circuit-Optimization-for-Hamiltonian-Simulation/blob/e97de3d2fb81b2057a1e45d1be82b8d9444792a3/Paulihedral/real_system.py#L39) inserts the measurement on a circuit after its transpilation.
However, the transpilation is done with the `optimization_level=3` option, which means that the measurements plays an important role in the optimization.
For example, `OptimizeSwapBeforeMeasure` is a pass that removes the swap gates before the measurement, leading to a non-equivalent circuit (See the doc regarding this level 3: [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/_modules/qiskit/transpiler/preset_passmanagers/level3.html)).
In the line 39 of the current code, adding the measurement to `qc1` after the transpilation prevents them from being used in the optimization and ultimately leads to a different circuit. See the different qasm of the generated code.

**Original code:**
The measurements are placed naively in order.
```qasm
barrier q[0],q[1],q[2],q[3],q[4],q[5],q[6],q[7],q[8],q[9],q[10],q[11],q[12],q[13];
measure q[0] -> meas[0];
measure q[1] -> meas[1];
measure q[2] -> meas[2];
measure q[3] -> meas[3];
measure q[4] -> meas[4];
measure q[5] -> meas[5];
measure q[6] -> meas[6];
measure q[7] -> meas[7];
measure q[8] -> meas[8];
measure q[9] -> meas[9];
measure q[10] -> meas[10];
measure q[11] -> meas[11];
measure q[12] -> meas[12];
measure q[13] -> meas[13];
```

**Adding the measurement before transpilation:**
The measurement are optimized with level 3:
```qasm
barrier q[4],q[3],q[2],q[1],q[0],q[5],q[6],q[7],q[8],q[9],q[10],q[13],q[12],q[11];
measure q[4] -> meas[0];   # DIFFERENT MAPPING
measure q[3] -> meas[1];   # DIFFERENT MAPPING
measure q[2] -> meas[2];
measure q[1] -> meas[3];   # DIFFERENT MAPPING
measure q[0] -> meas[4];   # DIFFERENT MAPPING
measure q[5] -> meas[5];
measure q[6] -> meas[6];
measure q[7] -> meas[7];
measure q[8] -> meas[8];
measure q[9] -> meas[9];
measure q[10] -> meas[10];
measure q[13] -> meas[11];  # DIFFERENT MAPPING
measure q[12] -> meas[12];
measure q[11] -> meas[13];  # DIFFERENT MAPPING
```

Note that the same problem happens with `qc3` in the next lines.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
I injected the alternative circuit in the code and I checked if the qasm codes are the same. Unfortunately it leads to different results.
You can use the code below:
```python
...
    qc1 = synth_qaoa1(a2, graph=graph, gamma=gamma, beta=beta)

    # AS PER API AND QISKIT DOCUMENTATION
    from copy import deepcopy
    qc1_alternative = deepcopy(qc1)
    qc1_alternative.measure_all()


    # TRANSPILATION
    qc1 = transpile(
        qc1, basis_gates=['u3', 'cx'],
        backend=backend, coupling_map=coup, optimization_level=3)

    # ALTERNATIVE: MEASUREMENT BEFORE TRANSPILATION
    qc1_alternative = transpile(
        qc1_alternative, basis_gates=['u3', 'cx'],
        backend=backend, coupling_map=coup, optimization_level=3)

    # ORIGINAL
    qc1.measure_all()

    # check if the ORIGINAL and the ALTERNATIVE are the same
    qasm_original = qc1.qasm()
    qasm_alternative = qc1_alternative.qasm()
    if qasm_original != qasm_alternative:
        print("Warning: qasm codes are different")
        print("Original:")
        print(qasm_original)
        print("Alternative:")
        print(qasm_alternative)
...
```

# What should happen?
The two qasm codes should be the same, thus the optimization should consider also the measurements.

# Any suggestions?
The program can be fixed by moving the measurement before the transpilation. Following the recommendation of Qiskit. See [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7642#issuecomment-1049280234)
