# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.25.1
- **Python version**: 3.10.0
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [quantum_entanglement.py](https://github.com/a-vanderbilt/Coding-WIth-Qiskit/blob/main/quantum_entanglement.py), the quantum circuit uses `measure_all()` method. However, there is already a classical register in the circuit, thus `measure_all(add_bits=False)` would be more appropriate to reuse the qubits.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
quantum_circuit = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2,2)
quantum_circuit.h(0)
quantum_circuit.cx(0,1)
quantum_circuit.measure_all()
```

# Any Suggestions?
What about replacing the `measure_all()` call with `measure_all(add_bits=False)` to reuse the qubits? Here is the suggested version:

```python
quantum_circuit = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2,2)
quantum_circuit.h(0)
quantum_circuit.cx(0,1)
quantum_circuit.measure_all(add_bits=False)
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day!
