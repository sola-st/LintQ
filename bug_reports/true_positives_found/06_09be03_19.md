# What is happening?
The instruction `measure_all` in the file [qrng.py](https://github.com/tula3and/qoupang/blob/23b71b9fac8381bc05d25ba646fe63fb9c64b6f2/qrng/qrng.py#L18) masures the qubits by adding an extra `ClassicalRegister`, making the circuit larger than it should be. At the same time, the existing `ClassicalRegister`, variable `c`, is not used at all.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Adding a print on the result measured in the circuit:
```python
from qiskit import *
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
q = QuantumRegister(48)
c = ClassicalRegister(48)
circuit = QuantumCircuit(q,c)
circuit.h(q)
for i in range(47):
    circuit.cx(q[i], q[47])
circuit.measure_all()
import string
table = string.ascii_uppercase + string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits
def hash8():
    hash_result = ''
    result = execute(circuit, backend, shots=1).result()
    count = result.get_counts(circuit)
    print(count)
    bits = max(count, key=lambda i: count[i])[:48]
    start = 0
    end = 6
    while (end <= 48):
        rand = int(bits[start:end], 2) % 63
        start += 6
        end += 6
        hash_result += table[rand]
    return hash_result
hash8()
```
Output:
```
{'101011111101100100111001000010110010010000111110 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000': 1}
```
Which shows how the program is running a program which is twice as large as it should be.

# What should happen?
The circuit should be measuring the qubits directly, without adding an extra register.

# Any suggestions?
Following the documentation of the [`measure_all`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.measure_all.html) method, it is possible to measure the qubits directly, without adding an extra register. The code should be changed to:
```python
circuit.measure_all(add_bits=False)
```
or with the `measure` method:
```python
circuit.measure(q, c)
```
This produces the following:
```
{'101011111101100100111001000010110010010000111110': 1}
```
As a consequence the slicing can be removed from the `hash8` function.
```python
# ORIGINAL
# bits = max(count, key=lambda i: count[i])[:48]
# NEW
bits = max(count, key=lambda i: count[i])
```
