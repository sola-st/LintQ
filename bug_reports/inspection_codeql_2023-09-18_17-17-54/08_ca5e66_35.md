# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.45.2
- **Python version**: 3.10.12
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [ghz.py](https://github.com/pnnl/NWQ-Sim/blob/f12a0ba0f2c26d806c8929b034c34ad18bf4cf83/cluster/dmsim/qiskit/test/ghz.py) the `qc.measure_all()` call creates a new classical register and does not use the one already provided during initialization via `qc = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits, n_qubits)`.
That would have led to a doubly sized classical register.

# What should happen?
I would have expected either no classical register to be created, or the existing one to be used.

# Any suggestions?

I could not find the specific file in the current main, but I assume it has been moved there, and I noticed it already fixed the problem with no classical register during initialization. Thus I leave the issue for reference but close it already.

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
