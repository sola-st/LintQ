# What is happening?
In the Python file [Constante_1_(0,0).py](https://github.com/Nat15005/DeutschYDeutsch-Jozsa/blob/07c15bcc325bfc04979230769f4075e1124fb0b9/Funciones_DEUTSCH/Constante_1/Constante_1_(0%2C0).py#L13) the qubit 0 is measured by never used, thus it would give the default value. Do you actually need qubit 0 at all?

Looking forward to your feedback.

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
