# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.25.1
- **Python version**: 3.8.0
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [neoh2evo.py](https://github.com/NEASQC/Variationals_algorithms/blob/main/misc/python_scripts/neoh2evo.py#L75), the `ansatz.compose(init_state, front=True)` call is effectively ignored because the returned value is not reassigned and the argument `inplace` is not used. As a result, there is no initial state in the ansatz passed to the VQE.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
...
# setup the initial state for the ansatz
from qiskit_mod.qiskit_nat import NeoHartreeFock

init_state = NeoHartreeFock(2*num_spin_orbitals, mixnum_particles, converter)

# setup the ansatz for VQE
from qiskit.circuit.library import TwoLocal

ansatz = TwoLocal(2*num_spin_orbitals, ['ry', 'rz'], 'cz',reps=2)

# add the initial state
ansatz.compose(init_state, front=True)

ansatz.draw()  # <-- this will not include the initial state
```

# What should happen?
I would have expected the initial state to be included in the ansatz passed to the VQE.

# Any Suggestions?
The `ansatz.compose(init_state, front=True)` call should be reassigned to `ansatz` or the `inplace=True` argument should be used to ensure the initial state is included in the ansatz passed to the VQE. Here is the suggested version:

```python
# add the initial state
ansatz = ansatz.compose(init_state, front=True)
```
or
```python
# add the initial state
ansatz.compose(init_state, front=True, inplace=True)
```
Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day
