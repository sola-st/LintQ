# What is happening?
In the file [Shor.py](https://github.com/fastflair/Tutorials/blob/ec3cec9ae4219f34f9a9980b3dfc33bad930e1e5/Quantum/ShorDecrypt/Shor.py#L321), in the function `construct_circuit`, the line `circuit.compose(iqft, qubits=self._up_qreg)` doesn't effectively add the inverse of the quantum fourier transform to the circuit.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
I inserted two prints in the around this function call:
```python
class Shor():

    def construct_circuit(self):
        ...

        # BEFORE COMPOSE
        before_circuit = circuit.qasm()

        # Apply inverse QFT
        iqft = QFT(len(self._up_qreg), inverse=True)
        circuit.compose(iqft, qubits=self._up_qreg)

        # AFTER COMPOSE
        after_circuit = circuit.qasm()

        # THE CIRCUIT SHOULD HAVE CHANGED:
        assert before_diagram != after_diagram, 'failed... they are the same'

        ...
```
Then I run it via:
```python
Shor().construct_circuit()
```
added at the end of the class.

But I get:
```
  File "Shor.py", line 330, in construct_circuit
    assert before_diagram != after_diagram, 'failed... they are the same'
AssertionError: failed... they are the same
```
And the two qasm representations are identical, thus the circuit hasn't changed.



# What should happen?
I would have expected the `circuit` to include the inverse quantum fourier transform.

# Any suggestions?
The problem is in the way `compose()` is used. See [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.compose.html).
The correct way to use it is:
```python
circuit = circuit.compose(iqft, qubits=self._up_qreg)
# or
circuit.compose(iqft, qubits=self._up_qreg, inplace=True)
```
