# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.45.2
- **Python version**: 3.10.12
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [task.py](https://github.com/draymond63/qosf-task-1/blob/cbcda1ace6efc80ad2554ea2b5c9c5b5288444ae/task.py#L38) there are `c_if` operations without any preceding measurement, meaning that their application will depend on the default value of the classical register, which is 0.

I would have expected them to be constant operation or to see a measurement before them.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
