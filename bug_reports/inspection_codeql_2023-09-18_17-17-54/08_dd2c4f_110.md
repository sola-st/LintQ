# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.25.1
- **Python version**: 3.10.0
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [mnist.py](https://github.com/dreaming-panda/quantum-ml/blob/main/mnist.py#L109), the `qc.measure_all()` call creates a new classical register and does not use the one already provided during initialization via `QuantumCircuit(31, 1)`, which also too small to measure all the output.
This results both in an unused classical bit and an extra register added automatically.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(31, 1)  # <-- this classical register is not used
train = torch.Tensor([1 for _ in range(64)]).long()
train[62:64] = 0
mnist_dataset = MNISTDataset(address_qubits=address_bits,qc=qc,dataset_qubits=dataset_bits,train=train)
mnist_model = MNISTMODEL(qc=qc,ancilla_bits=ancillas,dataset_qubits=dataset_bits, weights=weights_bits,output=output)
optimizer = QOptimizer(qc=qc,dataset_qubits=dataset_bits,output=output,data=mnist_dataset,model=mnist_model,allqubits=allqubits)
mnist_dataset.encode()
mnist_dataset.decode()
qc.measure_all()  # <-- this will create a new classical register
```

# What should happen?
I would have expected either no classical register to be added at the beginning or a larger classical circuit at initialization and the `qc.measure_all()` call to use that one.

## Any Suggestions?

Since the classical bit at the current stage is not used, what about using a larger classical register at the beginning with 31 bits and use that with the `measure_all` API at the end with `add_bits=False` to reuse the existing register? Here is the suggested version:

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(31, 31)  # Create a quantum circuit with 31 qubits and 31 classical bits
# ... rest of the code ...
qc.measure_all(add_bits=False)  # <-- use the existing classical register
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day
