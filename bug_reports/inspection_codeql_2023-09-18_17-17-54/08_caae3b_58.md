# What is happening?
In the generated Python file [source.py](https://github.com/ArfatSalman/qcross/blob/9ec9efff192318b71e8cd06a49abc676196315cb/miscellanea/intersting_cases/metamorphic_testing/06_948f90/source_948f90de9947418289b220bd2e61caa3.py#L57) have you ever experienced any problem with disappearing swap gates after transpilation? I know that optimization level 3 does some optimization that might act on final swaps in certain situations if there is no measurement in between.

# Any suggestions?
Have you thought of changing the generation template and anticipating the measurements before transpilation for example?

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
