# What is happening?
In the Python code provided [polarization rotator angle.py](https://github.com/2000maor/Quantum-Crypto/blob/main/polarization%20rotator%20angle.py), the `measure_all` API call creates a new classical register even though the `QuantumCircuit` already has a classical register of size `1`. This is due to the default behavior of `measure_all`, which always inserts a new register if not explicitly mentioned otherwise.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following Python code:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, Aer, execute
import numpy as np

p = 0

simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
initial_state = [np.sqrt(p), np.sqrt(1 - p)]
qc.initialize(initial_state, 0)
qc.measure_all()
print(qc.draw())
job = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
print(counts)
res = int(max(counts, key=counts.get)[0])
```
Output:
```
        ┌─────────────────┐ ░ ┌─┐
     q: ┤ Initialize(0,1) ├─░─┤M├
        └─────────────────┘ ░ └╥┘
   c: 1/═══════════════════════╬═
                               ║
meas: 1/═══════════════════════╩═
                               0
{'1 0': 1}
```

From the print statement, we can see that two classical registers are present: `c` and `meas`. The first one is the one we created, the second one is the one created by `measure_all`.

# What should happen?
I would expect the existing classical register to be used instead to avoid waste of space.

# Any suggestions?
Following the documentation of the [`measure_all`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.measure_all.html) method, it is possible to measure the qubits directly, without adding an extra register. The code should be changed to:

```python
qc.measure_all(add_bits=False)
```

This will prevent the creation of an unnecessary classical register when one already exists. As a side effect will also simplify the parsing of the result:
```python
res = int(max(counts, key=counts.get))
```

Output:
```
     ┌─────────────────┐ ░ ┌─┐
  q: ┤ Initialize(0,1) ├─░─┤M├
     └─────────────────┘ ░ └╥┘
c: 1/═══════════════════════╩═
                            0
{'1': 1}
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day!
