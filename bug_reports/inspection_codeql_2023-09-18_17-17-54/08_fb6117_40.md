# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.25.1
- **Python version**: 3.8.0
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [one_qubit.py](https://github.com/iQuHACK/Duckfebugging/blob/master/one_qubit.py), the `cx` and `cz` gates are used instead of the controlled `c_if` gates. Although the code most probably return a similar distribution, the code disagrees with the Qiskit official version that more closely follows the quantum teleportation specification.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
from qiskit import *

# Define register of 3 qubits
q = QuantumRegister(3)
c = ClassicalRegister(2)
circuit = QuantumCircuit(q,c)

# Generate entanglement
circuit.h(1)
circuit.cx(1, 2)
circuit.barrier()

# Perform Bell state measurement
circuit.cx(0, 1)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.measure(0, 0)
circuit.measure(1, 1)

# Operate on Bob's qubit given result
circuit.cx(0, 2)
circuit.cz(1, 2)

print(circuit)
```

The cx and cz gates are not conditioned on the classical register.

# Any Suggestions?
The code should probably use the `c_if` gates instead of the `cx` and `cz` gates. An example could be:

```python
q = QuantumRegister(3)
c1 = ClassicalRegister(1)
c2 = ClassicalRegister(1)
circuit = QuantumCircuit(q,c1,c2)
circuit.h(1)
circuit.cx(1, 2)
circuit.barrier()
circuit.cx(0, 1)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.measure(0, 0)
circuit.measure(1, 1)
circuit.x(2).c_if(c1, 1)
circuit.z(2).c_if(c2, 1)
print(circuit)
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day
