# What is happening?
In the Python file [ahmed154.py](https://github.com/ahmedkfu2020/-/blob/a205805a9dfaef2f8cb2ff0645c597b1b119747c/ahmed154.py#L12) have you considered that

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file and focusing on the first iteration of the loop:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit
from qiskit import execute, Aer
q = QuantumRegister(1)
# define a classical register with a single bit
c = ClassicalRegister(1,"c")
# define a quantum circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(q,c)

for i in range(1):  # changed this value from 3 to 1
    qc.h(q[0]).c_if(c,0)
    qc.measure(q,c)

# draw the circuit
qc.draw()
#       ┌───┐ ┌─┐
#  q0: ─┤ H ├─┤M├
#       └─╥─┘ └╥┘
#      ┌──╨──┐ ║
# c: 1/╡ 0x0 ╞═╩═
#      └─────┘ 0

# execute the circuit 100 times in the local simulator
counts = execute(qc,Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'),shots=100).result().get_counts()
print(counts)
# {'0': 58, '1': 42}
```
The first conditional gate is always constant because there are no measurements in between the beginning of the circuit (when the classical register is in the state 0) and the conditional gate.

# What should happen?
I would have expected something happening before the `c_if` or a constant gate.

# Any suggestions?
What about a constant gate before the `c_if` and then two iterations?

```python
from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit
from qiskit import execute, Aer
q = QuantumRegister(1)
c = ClassicalRegister(1,"c")
qc = QuantumCircuit(q,c)
qc.h(q[0])
qc.measure(q,c)
for i in range(2):
    qc.x(q[0]).c_if(c,0)
    qc.measure(q,c)

qc.draw()
#      ┌───┐┌─┐ ┌───┐ ┌─┐ ┌───┐ ┌─┐
#  q6: ┤ H ├┤M├─┤ X ├─┤M├─┤ X ├─┤M├
#      └───┘└╥┘ └─╥─┘ └╥┘ └─╥─┘ └╥┘
#            ║ ┌──╨──┐ ║ ┌──╨──┐ ║
# c: 1/══════╩═╡ 0x0 ╞═╩═╡ 0x0 ╞═╩═
#            0 └─────┘ 0 └─────┘ 0
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
