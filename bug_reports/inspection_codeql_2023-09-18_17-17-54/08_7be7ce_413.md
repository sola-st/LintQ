# What is happening?
In the Python file [transpiled_stabilizer_test.py](https://github.com/Serock3/Master_thesis_QEC_simulation/blob/bfc808d5e73b7e0bc77f7a36bdc373f7d27a4c8f/trash/transpiled_stabilizer_test.py#L412) the return value of the `compose` call is not used. Perhaps you wanted to reassign it to `circ`? Also there is no other circuit attached to it.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
