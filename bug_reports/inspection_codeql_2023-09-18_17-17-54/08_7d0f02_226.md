# What is happening?
In the Python file [Q04_Qiskit_installation_and_test.ipynb](https://github.com/Vishal-Mandal/bronze-qiskit-master/blob/1ff2c0f308c22934299fcb1f44a0cd92afd5a7a4/quantum-with-qiskit/Q04_Qiskit_installation_and_test.ipynb) there is a

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit
q = QuantumRegister(5, 'q')
c = ClassicalRegister(3, 'c')
qc = QuantumCircuit(q, c)
# omitted code
qc.measure(q[4],c[2]) # measure q[4] and write the output on c[2]

for i in range(5):
    if i % 2 ==0: qc.h(q[i])
    else: qc.x(q[i])
qc.draw()
#      ┌───┐
# q_0: ┤ H ├─────
#      ├───┤
# q_1: ┤ X ├─────
#      ├───┤
# q_2: ┤ H ├─────
#      ├───┤
# q_3: ┤ X ├─────
#      └┬─┬┘┌───┐
# q_4: ─┤M├─┤ H ├
#       └╥┘ └───┘
# c: 3/══╩═══════
#        2
```
As you can see after a measurement leading to a state collapse you apply a Hadamard gate.

Could you please explain why no meaningful operation is done in between the measurement and the Hadamard gate?

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
