# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.45.2
- **Python version**: 3.10.12
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [easy_qnn.py](https://github.com/rathilakshika/QNN/blob/964c9b91a8e990099fd419c90f4cf7ee877afff5/Loss_plots/generate_data/easy_qnn.py#L25) the variable `circuit` is created but never used. The subsequent assignment overrides it before it could be used.

# What should happen?
I would have expected either to use the `circuit` variable or to remove the first initialization.

# Any suggestions?
I would perhaps suggest removing the first initialization of the `circuit` variable.

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
