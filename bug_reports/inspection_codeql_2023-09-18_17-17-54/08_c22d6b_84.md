# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.25.1
- **Python version**: 3.10.0
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [INTERFERIBMC.ipynb](https://github.com/PCesteban/QCHACKIBM/blob/main/Different%20drafts/INTERFERIBMC.ipynb), the `circuit.measure_all()` call creates a new classical register and does not use the one already provided during initialization via `QuantumCircuit(1,1)`.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, Aer
from qiskit.quantum_info.operators import Operator
import qiskit as qkt

circuit = QuantumCircuit(1,1)
H_prime = Operator([[0.648640115686581, 0.7610952636313663], [0.7610952636313663, -0.648640115686581]])
circuit.unitary(H_prime, 0, label='H_prime')
circuit.measure_all()  # <-- this will create a new classical register

sim = qkt.Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
qobj = qkt.assemble(circuit)
result = sim.run(qobj).result()

counts = result.get_counts()
print(counts)  # <-- you can see the output here
# OUTPUT: {'0 0': 426, '1 0': 598}
```
The second bit is always 0, so the classical register is not used.

# Any Suggestions?
What about using the `add_bits=False` flag in the `measure_all` method to reuse the existing classical register? Here is the suggested version:

```python
circuit.measure_all(add_bits=False)
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day!
