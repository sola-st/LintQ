# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.45.2
- **Python version**: 3.10.12
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [Balanceada_2.py](https://github.com/Nat15005/DeutschYDeutsch-Jozsa/blob/07c15bcc325bfc04979230769f4075e1124fb0b9/Funciones_DEUTSCH-JOZSA/Balanceada_2.py) the circuit has 5 qubits, but only two are actually used. Moreover those that are not used give always constant values `0` as output, making them useless.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit import Aer

simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
circuit = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)

circuit.x(2) # ADDED BY ME TO GET NON ZERO OUTPUT

circuit.cx(2, 4)

circuit.measure([0,1,2,3,4], [4,3,2,1,0])
compiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, simulator)
job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(circuit)
print(counts)
```
Output:
```
{'00101': 1000}
```

# What should happen?
I would have expected all the qubits to be somehow used, but here more than half are unused.

# Any suggestions?
I would suggest using only two qubits:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit import Aer

simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
circuit = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

circuit.x(0)  # ADDED BY ME TO GET NON ZERO OUTPUT
circuit.cx(0, 1)

circuit.measure([0,1], [1,0])
compiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, simulator)
job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(circuit)
print(counts)
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
