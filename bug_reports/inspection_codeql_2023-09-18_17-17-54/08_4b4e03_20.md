# What is happening?
In the Python file [Task_3.py](https://github.com/Ta-SeenJunaid/Quantum-Computing/blob/f00d91ce67e7336649e38ee4d0ce33392cf1ae6d/Quantum%20Cryptography/Task_3.py#L19) there is a quantum `ch` gate after a measurement, are you sure you don't want to use a conditional gate instead?
See: https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.Instruction#c_if


Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
