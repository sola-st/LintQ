# Environment

- **qiskit.__version__**: 0.45.2
- **Python version**: 3.10.12
- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 20.04

# What is happening?
In the Python file [test_circuit_methods.py](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/test/python/qasm2/test_circuit_methods.py#L190) the circuit created in the test case is not very meaningful, the `c_if` gate is never triggered because the condition is always `False`.

https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/f4b50fbb2d3fe7871589fae898f6eadbad7c959b/test/python/qasm2/test_circuit_methods.py#L190

# How can we reproduce the issue?
Run the following code in the Python file:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit
from qiskit import execute, Aer
qr = QuantumRegister(1, "q")
cr0 = ClassicalRegister(4, "c0")
cr1 = ClassicalRegister(4, "c1")
ref = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr0, cr1)
ref.x(qr[0])
ref.x(qr[0]).c_if(cr1, 4)
ref.measure(qr[0], cr0[0])
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
counts = execute(ref, backend).result().get_counts()
print(counts)
```
Output:
```
{'0000': 1024}
```
The `c_if` gate is never triggered because the condition is always `False`.

# What should happen?
I would have expected the `c_if` gate to be triggered in some cases.

# Any suggestions?
What about replacing the gate with an hadamard gate and a `c_if` condition to check its result?

```python
from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit
from qiskit import execute, Aer
qr = QuantumRegister(1, "q")
cr0 = ClassicalRegister(4, "c0")
cr1 = ClassicalRegister(4, "c1")
ref = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr0, cr1)
ref.h(qr[0])
ref.x(qr[0]).c_if(cr1, 1)
ref.measure(qr[0], cr0[0])
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
counts = execute(ref, backend).result().get_counts()
print(counts)
```
Output:
```
{'0000 0000': 507, '0000 0001': 517}
```

Thanks in advance, I wish you a happy and productive day.
