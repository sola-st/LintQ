# What is happening?
The file [InefficientNot.py](https://github.com/timholthuijsen/QuantumProject/blob/bf410651cbdd41af4552a36be480b10bc412a40b/InefficientNot.py#L62) has two consecutive measurements on the same qubit and bit, making the second redundant.

# How can we reproduce the issue?
To reproduce the problem I visualized the circuit:
```python

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
def inefficientNOT(inefficiencies, inp, layout = [0], n_times = 100):
    """
    This NOT gate includes an int number of inefficiencies, which determines
    how many qc.x gates the NOT will apply. Note that inefficiencies
    should always be an odd number for the gate to function as a not

    """
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1) # A quantum circuit with a single qubit and a single classical bit
    qc.reset(0)

    if inp=='1':
        qc.x(0)

    qc.barrier()
    """We apply a predefined number of inefficiencies.
    Unfortunately, and contrary to our expectations, this did not yield a decreased
    accuracy result when running on a quantum computer. For the inefficiency-reduced accuracy,
    we will use the NOT() function instead"""
    for i in range(inefficiencies):
        print(i+1, "x gates have been added")
        qc.x(0)
    #barrier between gate operation and measurement
    qc.barrier()
    qc.measure(0,0)
    trial = qc.measure(0,0)
    return qc
    # OMITTED CODE

qc = inefficientNOT(
    inefficiencies=3,
    inp='1',
)
qc.draw()
```
Output:
```text
1 x gates have been added
2 x gates have been added
3 x gates have been added
          ┌───┐ ░ ┌───┐┌───┐┌───┐ ░ ┌─┐┌─┐

                                     0  0
```
Where two measurements are added.

# What should happen?
I would have expected a single measurement since adding two measurements on the same qubit and bit is redundant and makes the circuit more complex.

# Any suggestions?
I would remove the second measurement.
